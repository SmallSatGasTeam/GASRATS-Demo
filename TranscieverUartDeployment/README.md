# TranscieverUartDeployment Application

This deployment was auto-generated by the F' utility tool.

## Building and Running the TranscieverUartDeployment Application

In order to build the TranscieverUartDeployment application, or any other FÂ´ application, we first need to generate a build directory. This can be done with the following commands:

```
cd TranscieverUartDeployment
fprime-util generate
```

The next step is to build the TranscieverUartDeployment application's code.
```
fprime-util build
```

## Running the application and F' GDS

The following command will spin up the F' GDS as well as run the application binary and the components necessary for the GDS and application to communicate.

```
cd TranscieverUartDeployment
fprime-gds
```

To run the ground system without starting the TranscieverUartDeployment app:
```
cd TranscieverUartDeployment
fprime-gds --no-app
```

The application binary may then be run independently from the created 'bin' directory.

```
cd TranscieverUartDeployment/build-artifacts/<platform>/bin/
./TranscieverUartDeployment -a 127.0.0.1 -p 50000
```

## How the custom framer is implemented
- At the top of the file there's two variables called deframer and framer that you replace with your defined protocol
- Also `comStub` is an example framer implementation that is intended to be replaced, so I replaced it with our protocol in the `instances.fpp` and `topology.fpp`
