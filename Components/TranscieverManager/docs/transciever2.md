- We control it over I2C and we send/recieve data over UART (page 16)
- We can update the firmware on the fly, using their bootloader, but I'm not sure that's something we really want or need (page 24)
- Radio Packet Structure
    - uplink/downlink (the full packet starts with the first bullet point and ends with the last) (9.1)
        - Preamble (5 bytes)
            - Hard-coded value: 0xAAAAAAAAAA
        - Sync Word (1 byte)
            - Value: 0x7E
        - Data Field 1 (1 byte)
            - Size of data field 2 in bytes
        - Data Field 2 (0-128 bytes)
            - Payload
        - CRC16 (2 bytes)
            - I think this is some sort of cryptogrophy thing, but I'm not sure
            - It actually stands for cyclic redundancy check, which is an error-detecting code to check for errors in the data
            - It's applied to datafield 1 and 2
            - Its inital value is all 1's
                - 0xFFFF
                - 1111 1111 1111 1111
            - The most significant bit of each byte is processed first
            - How it works
                - uses the polynomial: $x^{16}+x^{12}+x^5+1$ which is `0x11021` or `10001000000100001`
                - then you divide the data by the polynomial which gives you the CRC16
                - I actually don't think we need to know this, just need to find someone who wrote the algoritim and apply it to Data-1 and Data-2
                    - the algorithm is called CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE
            - There's a CRC calculator within the `xHF and OBC Configurator` app, under Tools.
- How I think it'll all work
    - We should just have to specify the telemetry packetizer to work with our packets specifically, then send the packets to the transciever over I2C using fprime.  
    - Most info I've found out about the TlmPacketizer is [here](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/discussions/2560)
